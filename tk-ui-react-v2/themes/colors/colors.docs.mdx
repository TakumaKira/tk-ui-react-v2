A theme component for using the Colors Design Language and tokens.

## Get started

To use the theme in your app, install the theme and apply it on your component tree.
Themes are usually applied on the root of your component tree.

```tsx
export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Colors>
      <Homepage />
    </Colors>
  );
}
```

## Compose the theme

You can compose your theme to create specific variations such as Dark or Light themes, overriding some or all of its properties. 
To compose your theme, create a new component and use the theme as following:

```tsx
const myTokenOverrides: WallyThemeSchema = {
  backgroundColor: 'black'
};

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Colors overrides={myTokenOverrides}>
      <Homepage />
    </Colors>
  );
}
```
